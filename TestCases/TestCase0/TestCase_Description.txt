Objective : 
This Test Case tests whether the password_valid.py contains some code or not.

Failed Test :
We check the objective by making an object of Password class in the test_password.py.
On doing so we get a failed test message which shows 1 test case ran and 1 failed with error stating that the class "Password()" is not defined.
This is due to the fact that our password_valid.py contains 0 lines of code initially.

Passing Test :
Code is added in password_valid.py. This code defines a class names "Password()" with no methods yet.
In the test_password.py file, we import this module and create an object of it.
On running the test, the message states that the test case is passed with zero errors.
