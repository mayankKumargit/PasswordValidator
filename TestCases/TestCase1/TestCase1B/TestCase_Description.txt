Objective : 
This Test Case Part B tests whether the password is null or not

Failed Test :
We are passing empty string as password and checking whether the function can identify empty password. 
The function isNull() in password_valid.py does not contain any code other than pass statement.
Hence the function returns None and test case failed.
