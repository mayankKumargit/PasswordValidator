Objective : 
It tests whether the password_valid.py contains checkDigit() function or not.

Failed Test :
We check the objective by making an object of Password class in the test_password.py and trying to call the function to check whether the password has at least one digit or not.
On doing so we get a failed test message which shows 6 test cases ran and 1 failed with error stating that the class "Password()" does not contain any function called checkDigit().
This is due to the fact that our password_valid.py does not contain any such function.
