Objective : 
It tests whether the password_valid.py contains checkLowercase() function or not.

Failed Test :
We check the objective by making an object of Password class in the test_password.py and trying to call the function to check whether the password has at least one lowercase character or not.
On doing so we get a failed test message which shows 5 test cases ran and 1 failed with error stating that the class "Password()" does not contain any function called checkLowercase().
This is due to the fact that our password_valid.py does not contain any such function.

Passed Test :
Code is added in password_valid.py. This code defines a class names "Password()" with one method checkLowercase(). In the test_password.py file, we import this module and create an object of it and called the function checkLowercase()
On running the test, the message states that 5 test cases ran and 5 test cases passed with zero errors.
