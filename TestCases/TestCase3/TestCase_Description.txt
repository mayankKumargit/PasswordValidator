Objective : 
It tests whether the password_valid.py contains checkUppercase() function or not.

Failed Test :
We check the objective by making an object of Password class in the test_password.py and trying to call the function to check whether the password has at least one uppercase character or not.
On doing so we get a failed test message which shows 4 test cases ran and 1 failed with error stating that the class "Password()" does not contain any function called checkUppercase().
This is due to the fact that our password_valid.py does not contain any such function.
